## LSL Scripting

AVsitterPlus allows creators to trigger animations with their own scripts through "Link Messages" and provides the ability to add [BUTTONS](/avsitterplus_avp_positions.html#button) to menus that send user-defined Link Messages to custom scripts. The examples below are intended only as examples, and to use them correctly you first need to have a decent knowledge of [LSL scripting](http://wiki.secondlife.com/wiki/LSL_Portal).

See [AVsitterPlus Scripting](/avsitterplus_scripting.html) for details on scripting.
